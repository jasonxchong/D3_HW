					<h3>How Does Poverty Levels At Our State Level Impact Our Miliatry Service?</h3>
					<p> This anaylsis measures the correlation between poverty levels at a state level and active military participation rates.
						The assumption is that states with higher poverty level would have higher particpation rates since economic factors such as
						employement rate, education and other welfare may not provide citizens those opportunities. The correlation of the data resulted
						in a calculation of -.415 which does show that there is some correlation but it can also be spotty. The outlier is Puerto Rico 
					    as they have high poverty levels but low service rates.
